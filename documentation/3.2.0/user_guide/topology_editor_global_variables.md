Alien 4 cloud provide a very convenient system that allows to reference contextual (application/location) variables in a topology through the usage of TOSCA input functions. This section details how you can reference this variables in the topology and how they work.

# Advanced inputs

This section describe how you can use internal variables defined in __location__ or __application__. Those parameters
could be used as inputs for node template's or capabilities' properties.

Our target for this feature is to allow internal prefixes to target meta-properties over different elements :


{: .table .table-bordered}
| Targeted element | Internal prefix | Description |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
|*location*      | `loc_meta_`| Targets *meta-properties* defined on a location |
|*application*| `app_meta_` , `app_tags_` | Targets *meta-properties* or *tags* defined on an application |

## Define a property as an internal input

When you define a topology, you may want to define some node properties as inputs. An input is
by default a value required to the user in order complete the topology and deploy.

You can define any property as input and then set its value in the deployment page or indicate
that the input is bound to an internal variable defined on a *location* or the *application* for example.The name syntax of an internal input is:

`<INTERNAL_PREFIX><TARGET_PROPERTY>`

where *TARGET_PROPERTY* can be a tag's or a meta property's name.

For example, let's say that we want to use one of the meta properties defined on our application : **target_client**
First, we set the wanted property as an input. This will leads to the creation of a new input named after the property's name.
Then we have to rename the created input following the above syntax, and using the application meta prefix: `app_meta_`**target_client**

If you have some tags or meta-properties defined on your location, same syntax :

- `loc_meta_`**MYAPP_META1**
- `loc_meta_`**MYAPP_META2**
- `app_tags_`**MYAPP_TAG1**
- `app_tags_`**MYAPP_TAG2**

{%warning%}
<h5>Meta property naming</h5>
**Note :** avoid dot `.` character in you meta-property name (e.g. my.meta.1)
<h5>Missing values</h5>
We have two possible cases regarding an input and the targeted meta-property :

- **requirted** property : if the provided value doesn't exist as input the property will stay marked as __missing__ and the topology not deployable
- **optional** property : if the provided value doesn't exist you will have a `warning` but the deployment will still be possible
{%endwarning%}

In fact, the deployment steps will help you handle *warnings* and *tasks* for a good deployment setup.
