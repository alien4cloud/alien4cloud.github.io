# Topology validation

In the topology validation  view you can see the validation of the current topology and the last topology saved.
The current validation is the validation of the last topology saved with the pending operations.
The validation of the last saved topology is important because it's the topology used in the deployment.
Be sure to save a valid topology if you want to deploy.
