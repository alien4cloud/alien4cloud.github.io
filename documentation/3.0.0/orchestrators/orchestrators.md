This section details configuration of supported orchestrators in alien 4 cloud.

From the 3.0.0 version, we  currently officially support the __Yorc__ orchestrator.

In 2.0.0, we previously supported __Cloudify 3__, as well as __Cloudify 4__. and are working with Cloudsoft on the support of Apache Brooklyn.

In 1.4.0, we added experimental support of __Marathon__, a meta-framework for __Mesos__ which enables scheduling and orchestration of __Docker containers__.

If you are looking for information on how to contribute or integrate other orchestrators or deployment technologies please check out our contribute section.
