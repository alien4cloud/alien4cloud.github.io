## Overview

The [**Y**stia **Orc**hestrator](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides applications lifecycle management over hybrid infrastructures​:

 * Infrastructure as a Service (Google Cloud, AWS, OpenStack, Hosts Pool)​
 * Container as a Service (Kubernetes)​
 * High Performance Computing (Slurm)
 * Applications and Components are written in TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications), an OASIS consortium standard language to describe a topology of cloud based web services, their components and relationships, portable across infrastructures.

A4C 3.0.X comes with a provider plugin that manages interactions with a running Yorc instance.
