Alien 4 cloud provides a TOSCA topology editor that allows to define your topologies in an easy way.

The editor aims to provide very simple drag and drop edition for the most complex topologies and is accessed from two different places:

* From the topology catalog to edit a reusable template (topology templates from the catalog can be used to create new applications from a template or to provide complex reusable building blocks through topology substitution).
* From the application to edit the associated topology.
