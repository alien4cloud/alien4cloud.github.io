<h5>Premium feature</h5>
This section refers to the a premium feature.
{% endinfo %}

Once an application is deployed, we might need to be able to upgrade some file (config, binary, licence file) related to a given component without modifying the topology itself (no change on relationships, no node added, no instances added), or maybe just to execute a custom operation to put or get some informations from the deployed nodes.  
The **Cloudify 3 premium plugin** plugin allows you to perform such actions. When the plugin is enabled, you can see `patches` and `operations` sub menu on the left side bar on the runtime view. The two concepts are very similar in some ways.

# What is it?
Functionally speaking, a patch / operation can be defined as a set of actions that will be executed on a node, for example upgrading a version or the configuration of a component, accessing some informations about a component, etc....  It is linked to a specific version of a node, and can be triggered for one or more instances of that node.  
Technically speaking, it can be a script file, or a zipped set of files, that one will upload once the topology is deployed, via the provided user interface. Supported format are: *bach file*, *bat*, *zip* and *tar.gz*.

If you provide an archive, you must make sure to have only one script file at the root.
{%endwarning%}

# Creation
Once you have your script or archive, you can upload it. In the modal, choose a name for your operation, eventually add a description,
and select a node.  
Note that in the list of nodes, there are natie nodes such as ___Compute___, ___Network___ and ___Storage___ nodes.

# execution
Alien4Cloud interface allows the user to trigger a patch/operation execution for one or all instances of a node. There are somehow specific behaviors.

## Operation execution
An operation can be triggered as many time as we want on a node.

## Patches execution
As stated above, triggering a patch execution is possible via the provided user interface.  
However and most importantly, once a patch is added for a node, it will be triggered automatically on:

* all the instances of the node, in case of fail-over
* all the newly created instances in case of scaling up.

If the execution is successful, the patch is acknowledged and you can see it on the view.  

***TODO***: image patch acknowledged  

Once a patch is executed and acknowledged on an instance, it will not be executed again even if it is triggered.

# Deletion
You can remove a patch / operation if you need to via the provided user interface. However, note that if the patch / operation has already been executed on some instances, deleting it will not undo the changes on those instances.  
Also, when an application environment is deleted, all patches and operations related to a deployment with that environment are deleted.
