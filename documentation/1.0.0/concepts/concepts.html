        <p>Let us introduce you to concepts in Alien 4 Cloud. Alien 4 Cloud is an application that allows people in the enterprise to collaborate in order to provide self-service deployment of complex applications taking in account the different experts through a rôle based portal.</p>

<p>Alien 4 Cloud want to provide self-service no only for users but also for development teams that want to build and deploy complex applications and leverage cloud resources to deploy their environments in minutes.</p>

<p>In order to provide enterprise self-service portal, alien 4 cloud leverages the following concept:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud</strong>: Deployment target (cloud or set of physical machines)</li>
  <li><strong>Components</strong>: Software components to deploy</li>
  <li><strong>Topologies</strong> (or blueprints): Description of multiple software components assembled together (to build an application).</li>
  <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Actual applications to deploy with <em>environments</em> and <em>versions</em> each of them being associated with a topology.</li>
  <li><strong>TOSCA</strong>: An emerging standard to describe service components and their relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these notions Alien 4 Cloud provide a comprehensive set of <strong>roles</strong> that can be mapped in flexible manners to the people and structure of an enterprise IT department.</p>
