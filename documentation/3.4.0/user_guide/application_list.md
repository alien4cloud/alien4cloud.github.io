To reach the list of applications you have access to you should click on the ![Applications navigation button](../../images/3.4.0/user_guide/applications/app_menu.png){: height="26px" .inline} button in the main navigation bar.

The screen shows you the list of applications you can access (basically any application you have a role assigned to). If you are a platform admin you can see all applications on the list. For each application you can toggle the display of it's environments to see the state of the deployment as well as the deployed version.

Just click on an application to reach the application detail page where you will be able to see application general information and reach the deployment outputs (application url etc.).
