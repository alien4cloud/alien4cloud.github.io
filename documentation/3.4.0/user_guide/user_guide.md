## Welcome to Alien's user guide!

This section will explain you how to use Alien 4 Cloud. If you have not read it yet, you should probably start to read the [concepts section](#/documentation/3.0.0/concepts/concepts.html).

* As a __Platform admin__ you probably should read first the [Administration Guide](#/documentation/3.0.0/admin_guide/index.html) in order to install and setup Alien 4 Cloud. Once done, having your alien4cloud instance up and running you will be interested in the user guide [administration section](#/documentation/3.0.0/user_guide/admin.html) that explain how you can configure users (to grant permissions), plugins, orchestrators, services, and more.
* As a __Dev-Ops__ we suggest you to read how to use alien's [TOSCA catalog](#/documentation/3.0.0/user_guide/catalog.html) section and to get familiar with [TOSCA reference](#/documentation/3.0.0/devops_guide/tosca_concepts.html). You can also look at our [LAMP Stack Tutorial](#/documentation/3.0.0/devops_guide/lamp_stack_tutorial/lamp_stack.html) that provides a good kickoff on building components with TOSCA.
