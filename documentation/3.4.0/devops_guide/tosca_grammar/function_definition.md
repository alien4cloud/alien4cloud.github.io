Work in progress, details the functions that can be applied to properties and function input parameters.

A function definition defines a named function to evaluate at runtime, and that can be used as property, attribute or input parameter. It is used to  dynamically retrieve a value from property definition defined on an entity.

## Reserved function keywords
The following keywords may be used in some  TOSCA function in place of a TOSCA Node or Relationship Template name. They will be interpreted when evaluation the function at runtime.

{: .table .table-striped }
| Keyword         | Valid context                | Description |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:------------|
| SELF            | Node Template or Relationship Template                   | Node or Relationship Template instance that contains the function at the time the function is evaluated. |
| SOURCE          | Relationship Template only |Node Template instance that  is at the source end of the relationship that contains the referencing function. |
| TARGET          | Relationship Template only |Node Template instance that  is at the target end of the relationship that contains the referencing function. |
| HOST            | Node Template only |Node that “hosts” the node using this reference (i.e., as identified by its HostedOn relationship). |
