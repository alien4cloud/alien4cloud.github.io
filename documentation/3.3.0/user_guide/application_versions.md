Version numbers follows the maven convention i.e < major >.< minor >.< incremental >-< qualifier >. Every version that contains the string `-SNAPSHOT` is recognized as SNAPSHOT. This means that in alien4cloud, just like in maven a version as 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-ALPHA or 1.0.0-ALPHA-SNAPSHOT is recognized as SNAPSHOT and can be modified. However, we recommend you to keep -SNAPSHOT at the end of the version string.

When creating topology variants you will assign a qualifier to the variant. Alien 4 cloud will automatically add the variant qualifier as first qualifier in the variant version string. So if your version is 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT and your variant qualifier is DEV, the version number will be 1.0.0-DEV-SNAPSHOT, if the version number was 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-ALPHA, the variant version number will be 1.0.0-DEV-SNAPSHOT-ALPHA etc.

# Configure versions

When Alien4Cloud creates a default version, you will soon have to create new versions for your application. In Alien4Cloud, a version can have multiple different topologies that we call __Topology Versions__.

To manage Versions and Topology versions, you must go to the application version management screen. To do so you must have the *APPLICATION_MANAGER* role for the application (not to be confused with the global *APPLICATIONS_MANAGER* role) or the global *ADMIN* role.

From the application list screen click on the application for which you want to manage versions and then click on the __version button__ ![Versions button](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/versions_button.png){: height="26px" .inline} found in the application main page.

This screen displays all the versions of the application (by default only a single 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT version is created) and for each version the list of it's topology variants and their unique version number.

![Version list (default version)](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/version_list.png)

## Create new version

You can create a new version by clicking the __New version__ button ![New version](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_version_button.png){: height="26px" .inline}. Once clicked the new version modal will open so you can configure the new version.

* __Version number__: This is the number of the new version to create. It must be unique for this application and must follow the maven (and TOSCA) version pattern.
* __Description__: Optional description for this version.
* __Initialize topology from__: When creating a new version alien 4 cloud allow you to initialize one or multiple topology versions for this application version. The default option is (_Previous version_).

{%inittab%}
{% tabcontent From previous version %}
![Create new version from previous](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_version_modal_previous.png)

This option allow you to duplicate all the topology versions from a previous application version for the new application version.
{%endtabcontent%}

{% tabcontent From Topology template %}
![Create new version from template](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_version_modal_template.png)

When choosing the template creation, only a single application topology version will be created. The associated topology will be based on the selected template.
{%endtabcontent%}

{% tabcontent From scratch %}
![Create new version from scratch](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_version_modal_scratch.png)

When choosed, only a single application topology version will be created. The associated topology will be empty.
{%endtabcontent%}
{%endinittab%}

## Update version
The _description_ field of a version can be updated anytime.
However it is not the case for the version number. First of all, a __released__ version number __CANNOT BE UPDATED__.   Therefore, make sure your version is a _SNAPSHOT_ one before trying to update.
The table below sumarize the cases when a version number update can be done:

{: .table .table-bordered}
| State | Description | Updatable |
|:---------|:------------|
| Unused | The version is not yet assigned to an environment | YES |
| Assigned | The version is assigned to an environment and maybe configured for a future deployment. | YES |
| Deployed | The version is assigned to a deployed environment | NO |
| Exposed as Service | The version is assigned to an environment (deployed or not), which is exposed as a service.| NO |

## Delete version

Deletion of a version will remove all topology versions and associated topologies. It can be achieved through the __trash button__ ![Delete version](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/delete_button.png){: height="26px" .inline} on the same line as the version you want to delete.

## Create new topology version

You can create a new variant topology for an application version by clicking the __plus button__ ![New topology version](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_topo_version_button.png){: height="26px" .inline} on the same line as the version for which to create a topology version/variant. This opens the new topology version modal:

![Create new version from previous version](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/new_topology_version_previous.png)

* __Qualifier__: Creation of a new topology version requires the configuration of a specific qualifier for this topology version/variant. The generated version number is displayed on the side of the qualifier field.
* __Description__: Optional description for this topology version/variant.
* __Initialize topology from__: When creating a new topology version alien 4 cloud allow you to initialize it's associated topology. The default option (Previous version) allow you to initialize the topology from the one of a single topology version (either from the same version or another version of the application). Of course you can also choose to create the version from a template or from scratch.

## Delete topology version

Deletion of a topology version will also delete it's associated topologies. It can be achieved through the __trash button__ ![Delete version](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/applications/delete_button.png){: height="26px" .inline} on the same line as the topology version you want to delete.
