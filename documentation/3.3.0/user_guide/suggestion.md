 Suggestions provide default values for some usual fields. The suggestions are available on the properties `architecture`, `type` and `distribution` of the capability `tosca.capabilities.OperatingSystem`. For example, when you set the distribution property of a Compute, Alien will suggest some value.

If your value is not in the suggestions, a modal will appear and you can add the new value to the suggestions values.
