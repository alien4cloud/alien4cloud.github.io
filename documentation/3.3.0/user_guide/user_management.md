<h5>LDAP integration</h5>
If you wish to integrate with an LDAP directory please go [here](#/documentation/3.0.0/admin_guide/ldap.html).

Note that you can use LDAP for users and eventually role management. You can also manage roles in Alien even for LDAP user if you wish. In addition you can have users managed in LDAP and create some additional user that will be managed within Alien.

<h5>SAML integration with KeyCloak</h5>
If you use the premium version and wish to use SAML please check the documentation [here](#/documentation/3.0.0/admin_guide/saml_with_keycloak.html).

<h5>Roles</h5>
In order to edit users in Alien 4 Cloud you must have the ADMIN role. Default username and password when starting alien 4 cloud are _admin_ / _admin_
{%endinfo%}

# User(s)

In order to manage users go the to page by clicking on the ![Go to admin](../../images/user_guide/admin/admin_button.png){: .inline} button in the navigation bar. Then click on the user tab of the administration side navigation bar ![Go to user management](../../images/user_guide/admin/users/users_menu_side.png){: .inline} or on the user main icon.

The user page allows you to manage both users and groups. On the user tab you can search users and see the list of users matching your request.

## Create user

Admin is responsible for setting up the username (that will be used for login) and the password of the user.

{%warning%}
<h5>Limitations</h5>
We are working on adding the ability for a user to edit it's details but this is currently not an available feature. Changing user details can now be done only by an ADMIN user through the REST API.
Of course when using LDAP integration the password are managed by LDAP and there is no requirement for any management in Alien.

{: .table .table-bordered}
| Role | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ADMIN                | Manages users, plugins, configure clouds + all other roles. |
| APPLICATIONS_MANAGER | Create new application(s). |
| ARCHITECT            | Create and edit topology template(s). |
| COMPONENTS_BROWSER   | [Deprecated] Not used anymore for validation. Can list components and see details for any of them |

A user with no roles can log-in and view the resources for which he has been granted. For example a user with no global roles can still access and manage applications on which he has _resources_ roles (see application and environments roles).
