Once you have created or uploaded an archive that contains a topology you should be able to see it in the browse topology tab of the catalog. Search and filters is working in a similar fashion as the components browsing tab.

![Topology template list](../../images/3.3.0/user_guide/catalog/topologies/list.png)

Topology templates can be used when [creating a new application](#/documentation/3.0.0/user_guide/application_management.html). You also can view and [edit the topology](#/documentation/3.0.0/user_guide/topology_editor.html) by clicking on the desired element in the list.
