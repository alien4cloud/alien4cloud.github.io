ALIEN has been designed to be easily extended and integrated with other systems. It uses a plugin mechanism in order to provide extensions, and the REST API makes it easy to integrate.

The REST API documentation can be browsed directly on ALIEN's server (http://\<alien-url\>/api-doc/index.html) and this section will not provides more details about it.

This section gives a focus to ALIEN extensions through the plugin mechanism. In order to understand plugins it is important to know how ALIEN is designed and how plugins are managed by ALIEN.
