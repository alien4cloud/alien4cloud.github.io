        <p>ALIEN has been designed to be easily extended and integrated with other systems. It uses a plugin mechanism in order to provide extensions, and the REST API makes it easy to integrate.</p>

<p>The REST API documentation can be browsed directly on ALIEN’s server (<code>http://\&lt;alien-url\&gt;/api-doc/index.html</code>, e.g. <code>http://localhost:8088/api-doc/index.html</code>) and this section will not provides more details about it.</p>

<p>This section gives a focus to ALIEN extensions through the plugin mechanism. In order to understand plugins it is important to know how ALIEN is designed and how plugins are managed by ALIEN.</p>

<h3 id="mock-plugin">Mock plugin</h3>

<p>If you want to try out Alien 4 Cloud but not use a real cloud for deployments you can use the mock PaaS Provider plugin. This is a plugin that we use for our tests and that mock the PaaS orchestrator.</p>

<div class="note warning">
<p>The mock plugin does not allow you to test any of your components as it do not deploy anything or even call your scripts. To do so you should use a real PaaS Provider plugin like cloudify plugin and deploy on a local cloud technology like Virtua Box or Docker (note that docker support will come with support of cloudify 3).</p>
