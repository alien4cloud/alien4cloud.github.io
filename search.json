Why Cloud Computing is becoming prime development and deployment model for a number of applications.

As well agility is reached when proper collaboration between Dev and Ops teams, and their business sponsor, is achieved. Even if a large number of solutions exist in the Cloud ecosystem, the ecosystem is not consolidated. Architectures, APIs, technologies and infrastructures are still evolving a lot.

Knowing the investment term in the Applications from development to deployment (usually several years), and the legacy, it is important to protect the investment in the Application lifecycle, from moving parts, at any level possible. What Alien4Cloud aims at addressing some of these problems by providing the following capabilities : Ease the design and portability of Applications by leveraging TOSCA (an emerging standard driven by OASIS foundation) Isolate the application evolution from deployment technologies and infrastructures, allowing to integrate with any deployment layer and infrastructure Accelerate Application Infrastructure Design and improve reusability by providing a Components and Blueprints catalog Ease collaboration between Development and Deployment teams across the Application lifecycle in creating the Components and Blueprints to fill the catalog Integrate with existing Enterprise systems (Dev and Ops) through REST API and pluggable strategies Check current roadmap for details on where we are and where we go. Standard support Alien4Cloud supports OASIS TOSCA an emerging standard addressing applications portability in the cloud. We believe that applications cloud enablement should be done in an open way, free of any lock-in. No lock-in meaning that the application should freely move from one environment to the other with smallest effort possible. Therefore, it needs to abstract itself from the underlying infrastructure technical adherence, and define its infrastructure requirements and architecture, independently from each Cloud Provider’s Infrastructure Catalog. If not done, even if, technical compability between vendors could exist in theory (yet to be confirmed by reality), Infrastructure Catalog alignment between providers is very unlikely to happen as each provider is focusing in delivering best value to its customers and does not spend time aligning with others, especially when they may be competitors. As an analogy, can you easily compare your Telecom providers offerings ? We bet that the same will happen with Cloud providers, and it has already started. TOSCA enables the expression of Application Requirements on the Infrastructure and its QOS/SLA, in an open way, opening the door to optimized placement of Applications in the Cloud Infrastructures based on customer choice at its heart. We know about Infrastructure As Code, with TOSCA, we enter in to the era of “Application Requirements as Code” easing Application lifecycle management across several Cloud infrastructures. By increasing service and application portability in a vendor-neutral ecosystem, TOSCA will enable : Portable deployment to any compliant cloud Smoother migration of existing applications to the cloud Flexible bursting (consumer choice) Dynamic, multi-cloud provider applications Note: TOSCA Simple profile is a working draft and is not released yet to public. Current Alien 4 Cloud version is using a Alien 4 Cloud’s specific DSL that is really close to the latest TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML TC work. Open-Source We decided to build Alien4Cloud and give it to the community in order to allow Application Requirements modelling in a TOSCA format, in a collaborative way, between all participants involved in Application Infrastructure Requirements definition. It is provided with an Apache 2 license in order to favour contributions from external teams or individuals. Please check our Contribute page to see how you can help. What it is not Alien4Cloud focuses on Design, Collaboration, Application Lifecycle Management and later Governance, but leverages other existing open source projects that help orchestrating cloud applications and which focus on runtime aspects such as Cloudify . Alien4Cloud does not aim to provide applications deployment runtime. We believe that there are already a number of viable options there (some of them not being TOSCA compliant, btw) and we want to integrate more than replace. We do it in an open way through plug-in approach to allow you to leverage your best tools or skills. Status Alien 4 Cloud is now released in 1.0.0 version. This version is used in real-life projets inside FastConnect in order to provide self-service, industrialisation and collaboration in the design and management of applications blueprints. We especially use version 1.0.0 to deploy hadoop cluster (see Hadoop Self Service project page ) Which version to choose ? Basically the question depends on your timeframe, on the features you are looking from and on the support level you need. * 1.0.0 is our most stable version and is the latest version that we support. * 1.1.0 is still in development and things can change if you start using it. On the other hand all new features are developed in 1.1.0 so you may get more by choosing to start working with this version. We especially recommend that new POCs or project that will really start after we released the 1.1.0 (check our roadmap .

By default ALIEN 4 Cloud starts up an embedded ElasticSearch node. Of course when running in production it is recommended to use a remote cluster (ideally with high availability configured). Common configuration Common configuration allows you to configure the name of the elasticsearch cluster ( clusterName ), as well as the prefix_max_expansions (performance setting used for prefix queries). We recommend that you don’t change the default prefix_max_expansions value. If you wish to change one of the parameters, you should open the alien4cloud-config.yml file and go to the elasticSearch configuration section. elasticSearch : clusterName : escluster local : false client : false resetData : false prefix_max_expansions : 10 local and resetData should be left to false. Configure the embedded Elastic Search The embedded Elastic Search configuration elasticsearch.yml is a native elastic search configuration and you can find plenty of information on elastic search website on how you can configure it. However the main element you may wish to configure is elastic search storage directories: path : data : ${user.home}/.alien/elasticsearch/data work : ${user.home}/.alien/elasticsearch/work logs : ${user.home}/.alien/elasticsearch/logs Configure a remote Elastic Search (throw a no data node) Please note that you are encouraged to use the same version on client and cluster sides. You may hit some incompatibility issues when mixing major versions. In order to configure a remote Elastic Search, you should edit the following: In alien4cloud-config.yml file, edit the elasticSearch section and change client from false to true: elasticSearch : clusterName : escluster local : false client : true resetData : false prefix_max_expansions : 10 In the elasticsearch.yml make sure that the connection parameters matches the ones of your elasticsearch cluster. Example: discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled : false discovery.zen.ping.unicast.enabled : true discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts : 129.185.67.112 In this mode, a ‘client’ node is initialized and joins the cluster. It doesn’t store any data and act as a proxy. The machines must be visible for each other (in other words, they should be into the same network). Configure a remote Elastic Search (using a standalone transport client) In this mode, we use a simple standalone client that can be in another network as long as the cluster can be reachable. In alien4cloud-config.yml file, edit the elasticSearch section and set ‘client’ and ‘transportClient’ to true, and indicate the cluster host and port: elasticSearch : clusterName : escluster local : false client : true transportClient : true # a comma separated list of host:port couples hosts : 129.185.67.112:9300 resetData : false prefix_max_expansions : 10 In the elasticsearch.yml make sure that the cluster name is well defined (should be the same than the cluster). cluster.name : escluster Directories configuration ALIEN 4 Cloud store various files on the hard drive.

Create new application To create an application, go in the application list page and click on the New application button. You can directly create an application from a topology template if you have one. Configure versions In the version page you can create, edit or delete a version. As we already say in the application concept page, if you remove the ‘SNAPSHOT’ qualifier, your version will be released and the associated topology not editable. Configure environments In the environment management page you can create, edit or delete an environment. The version and the cloud are the most important informations. An environment cannot be deleted when it’s application is still deploy. Manage roles Application’s roles These roles defines actions allowed by role on a given application : Role Description APPLICATION_MANAGER Application manager can manage the application configuration, it’s versions and environments as well as user management for the application. APPLICATION_DEVOPS Dev ops role should be given to the applications developer. In ALIEN users with devops role on an application can edit the topologies of every SNAPSHOT versions. In addition to the applications roles, Application manager can specify some roles related to every single environment defined for the application. Environment’s roles These roles defines actions allowed by role on a given environment : Role Description APPLICATION_USER An application user on an environment is allowed to see the environment status as well as having access to the deployment output properties. DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER Deployment manager for an environment is responsible for configuration and deployment/undeployment of an environment. In order to be able to deploy/undeploy the environment the user must also have a DEPLOYER role on the location on which he wants to deploy. DEPLOYER role is configured on the location configuration by any user having the global ADMIN role. Advanced inputs This section describe how you can use internal variables defined in location or application . Those parameters could be used as inputs for node template’s or capabilities’ properties. Our target for this feature is to allow internal prefixes to target meta-properties over different elements : Targeted element Internal prefix Description location loc_meta_ Target meta-properties defined on a location application app_meta_ , app_tags_ Target meta-properties or tags defined on an application Define a property as an internal input When you define a topology, you may want to define some node properties as inputs. An input is by default a value required to the user in order complete the topology and deploy. You can define any property as input and then set its value in the deployment page or indicate that the input is bound to an internal variable defined on a location or the application for example.The name syntax of an internal input is: <INTERNAL_PREFIX><TARGET_PROPERTY> where TARGET_PROPERTY can be a tag’s or a meta property’s name. For example, let’s say that we want to use one of the meta properties defined on our application : target_client First, we set the wanted property as an input. This will leads to the creation of a new input named after the property’s name. Then we have to rename the created input following the above syntax, and using the application meta prefix: app_meta_ target_client If you have some tags or meta-properties defined on your location, same syntax : loc_meta_ MYAPP_META1 loc_meta_ MYAPP_META2 app_tags_ MYAPP_TAG1 app_tags_ MYAPP_TAG2 Meta property naming Note : avoid dot . character in you meta-property name (e.g. my.meta.1) Missing values We have two possible cases regarding an input and the targeted meta-property : requirted property : if the provided value doesn’t exist as input the property will stay marked as missing and the topology not deployable optional property : if the provided value doesn’t exist you will have a warning but the deployment will still be possible In fact, the deployment steps will help you handle warnings and tasks for a good deployment setup. Deploy your application To deploy an application you need to setup the context, you can do this in the Applications > Deployments sub-menu. The deployment setup is done by going through a number of hierarchical steps. Each step perform a validation of the deployment topology, and errors details are displayed. Note that you can not go to the next step when the current one is still not valid. Location selection The first thing to do is to select, among the displayed location, the one on which you would like to deploy. The proposed locations are determined by matching every existing location against the topology, done by a matcher plugin. For now, note that if no matching plugin is configured by the administrator, a default matcher is used, checking the following: The orchestrator managing a location can support all the artifacts contains in your topology (nodes and relationships implementations scripts) The current user have sufficient rights to deploy on the location Node substitution : Next step is to substitute some abstract nodes from your topology with resources provided by the selected location. In the meantime, you can edit some properties if you need to. Inputs: properties and artifacts Here you set values to inputs and provider deployments properties. Also, you can upload artifacts set as input in the topology. Here you need to select the value for your inputs . If they are some missing configuration in your topology, a todo list will be displayed. Once all those steps are valid, the deploy step is unlocked, and if your topology is valid and ready for deployment, you can hit the deploy button to proceed.

Here, in our example let’s say that we want to use one of the meta property defined on our cloud instance : MYMETACLOUD_1 MYMETACLOUD_2 The way to do that is to prefix the cloud meta property name by one of the internal prefixes define above and give the good name to have the good targeted value : cloud_meta_ MYMETACLOUD_1 cloud_meta_ MYMETACLOUD_2 If you have some tags or meta-properties defined on your application, same syntax : app_tags_ MYAPP_TAG1 app_tags_ MYAPP_TAG2 app_meta_ MYAPP_META1 app_meta_ MYAPP_META2 Meta property naming Note : avoid dot . caracter in you meta-property name (e.g. my.meta.1) Missing values We have two possible cases regarding an input and the targeted meta-property : requirted property : if the provided value doesn’t exist as input the property will stay marked as missing and the topology not deployable optional property : if the provided value doesn’t exist you will have a warning but the deployment will still be possible In fact, the deploying page will handle warnings and tasks list to help you in having a good deployment setup.

Applications in Alien 4 Cloud are visible only by users that have some roles within the application. In Alien 4 Cloud every application can have one or more versions and one or more environments. Versions A version represents a given state for the application topology. As we explained already a topology contains versioned informations for all components required to deploy the application meaning that a defined version of an application can be moved from a cloud to another with guaranty on the deployment content and insurance that the same components will be deployed. Snapshot and release When you create an application, Alien 4 Cloud creates a default version 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT . The qualifier SNAPSHOT is really important and means somehow In development . Indeed Alien 4 Cloud will prevent any modification of an application topology that is not a SNAPSHOT version. When you are ready to release a version just rename it and remove the SNAPSHOT qualifier (for example rename 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT to 0.1.0 ). Alien will then consider the version as released and it will not be possible to update the version. If you want to change the topology you will have to create a new version for your application (based on the previous version if you like). Environments An environment represents a deployment target for an application (of course an environment is linked to a cloud on which to deploy the environment). Like for application version, a default application environment named “Environment” is created when you create your application. This new environment is configured to target the default created version but without any associated cloud. You can specify the cloud in the environment management page or in the deployment page. You can also add a type to your environment and write a description. Application environment is a good way to design your application lifecycle accross the different environments and, eventually, clouds. For example you can design one or more development environments for your developers (on EC2 for example), and the pre-production and production environments on your own OpenStack(s). You can then move a version from an environment to another by switching the version on the environments and re-deploying it.

Node properties volumeId The provider can attach to a compute a created and formatted storage. Thus, you need to provide it for the ID of the volume you would like to attach, through the node property volumeId . size If no volumeId is provided, the provider will check for the size property, and use it to match a storage compute configured in the used cloud. Then, it will create a new volume, and format it ( default file system is ext4 ). How it works provider configuration If you have storage templates defined in your Clouify cloud’s file, you can configure them in the provider. Flow First you should add a BlockStorage node to your topology, attach it to a Compute node, and fill in if necessary the properties volumeId and size . When the provider process the topology for deployment, If the volumeId is defined , the provider will: try to locate the storage attach it to the compute mount it to the /mountedStorage directory. Else, if the size is defined , it will: Try to determin a storage template matching the exact given size. Create a volume based on the choosen template Format it using ext4 file system attach it to the compute mount it to the /mountedStorage directory. When the volume is created, his Id is updated in the deployed topology , so that it could be reused fro the next deployment. If neither the volumeId nor the size are defined, the provider will use the storage template difined with the lowest size to create the volume. When undeploying the application, the provider will: unmount the strorage detach it from the compute node to set free the resource. Note that the data are not deleted . Working with scaling policy If you are deploying the application with more than one instance, you can provide comma separated volumes Ids, ordered by instances id. Let take an example for illustration: deploying with the following configuations: minInstances : 1 maxInstance : 3 initialInstances : 3 volumeId : a,b,c Then, the instance 1,2,3 will use respectively the Ids a,b,c . As for the instance 4 , if a size is specified, it will be used to find the matching storage template (if not the default template is used) and create a volume ( d ). After then, the volumeId property will be updated to a,b,c,d . As stated previously, a storage created with the type tosca.nodes.BlockStorage is not deleted when undeploying the concerned application. However, if you want a storage auto-deletable, you can use the type alien.nodes.DeletableBlockStorage . That will ensure that the volume is destroyed, but of course the topology won’t be updated with the created volumeId.

Requirement for cloud creation Alien 4 cloud is not responsible for actual deployment orchestration but rather interact with existing orchestration technologies. In order to define a cloud you must configure plugins that will be used to actually perform deployment(s) on the defined cloud. Orchestrator plugins are refered in alien as PaaS Provider plugins. In order to configure a cloud you must have installed a paas provider plugin first see plugin management . Supported orchestrators We are currently supporting the opensource orchestrators cloudify 2 and cloudify 3 (Full re-written engine with new DSL - much better and flexible but that we felt prior to the up-comming 3.2 a bit light for production use). Cloud creation Once you have installed a plugin the admin can go on the cloud page and configure cloud. Remember that you can use the Alien 4 Cloud contextual help in order to be guided directly within the application. To create a cloud, just go in the cloud list page and click on the New cloud button. Cloud global configuration To configure a cloud, select it in the cloud list page and go to C onfiguration tab. Naming policy On every cloud, you can configure a naming policy that Alien 4 Cloud will use when deploying an application on a cloud. The naming policy will be used to identify the deployment on the cloud’s orchestrator (PaaS Provider). Most of the PaaS Providers will leverage this naming policy to name the resources used at the IaaS level also. To compose your own application naming policy, you can use the following entities and properties : environment : the environment linked to the deployment id name description environmentType : OTHER, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION_TESTS, USER_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS, PRE_PRODUCTION, PRODUCTION application : deployed application id name creationDate lastUpdateDate metaProperties [‘PROPERTY_NAME’] : meta-properties defined on the application time : current date at format yyyyMMddHHmm The default naming policy setting for any cloud is : environment.name + application.name Deployment name unicity The deployment name must be unique at a given time, the cloud administrator is responsible for choosing a pattern that should be unique or some application(s) may not be deployed (if a deployment with the same name is already running). Note that in we guaranty that an application name is unique across all applications and that an environment name is unique for a given application. However, when generating the application paaSId (final application name on the PaaS), all space character will be replaced by an _ . Therefore and as an example, if your naming policy involves the application name, you can not deploy simultaneously two applications named “ Test App ” and “ Test_App ” on the same cloud, as the generated paaSId will be in conflict. The main pattern to define a naming policy is to use + to concat different properties or text, for examples : environment.name + application.name + time application.id + environment.environmentType + '-US_ZONE' time + '__' + application.creationDate 'MY_APP' + '-WORDPRESS-' + time metaProperties['PROPERTY_NAME'] + '-' + time Empty meta properties Any empty property used in the naming policy expression will cause a deployment failure. Advanced use : the policy expression is based on SpEL ( Spring Expression Language ) and you could use its capabilities if you are familiar with it. Note : do not use the # Meta properties This feature allows you to define meta-properties on your cloud and then use them in your topology as an internal variable defined by your administrator. Obviously as a CLOUD_DELOYER , APPLICATION_USER or APPLICATION_MANAGER you won’t be able to change this value. At this stage, we assume that you’ve read the tutorial part to create global meta-properties as an ADMIN, to be more specific you know how to create meta-properties targeting cloud, application or environment. In global configuration in the meta-properties part you should be able to define a value for any cloud targeted meta-properties. Fill the desired values in order to use it later as in get_input for a property. Regarding your meta-property definition, you can add constraint on a meta property. In this case you must see constraint violation error if any in this cloud meta-properties form. PaaS Provider configuration The configuration tab on the cloud view allows to setup the provider specific configuration. It is mostly used to configure the provider connexion parameters so Alien 4 Cloud can communicate with the orchestrator engine server. This configuration may be specific to the orchestrator used and you should refer to the orchestrator specific guide. The next capture show the driver configuration of cloudify 2. More informations for cloudify 2 or cloudify 3 can be found on her specific documentation. Cloud resources setup Once created you must configure the cloud. Configuring a cloud requires several steps: Configure cloud resources (images and flavors) used for resources matching at deployment time. Configure the properties of the PaaS provider (that depends of the chosen one). Configure cloud resources Images In this page you need to add images to your cloud. An image describes the informations of a virtual machine template , you need to resume the images of your PaaS. For example, here the screen of a cloud with Ubuntu Vivid Vervet (the cloud is not enabled at this moment). Flavors Flavor is a combination of informations to describe the hardware templates used by the PaaS. They are 3 informations: number of core disk size RAM size Lot of flavors offer the flexibility for APPLICATION_MANAGER to choose the appropriate resources for an application. Like for images, here a screen of the flavor page (the cloud is not enabled at this moment). Configure PaaS templates For the next step, you need to enable your cloud. Just go in the details page and click one the enable button. If the startup has failed, check your PaaS driver configuration. When the cloud is enabled, go to image page to set the PaaS resource ID of your images. Once all images are complete, the alert icon on image tab will be deleted : After this, do the same thing with the flavor. When an ID is set, the number of template is updated : When the cloud is enabled, go to image page to set the PaaS resource ID of your images. Once all images are complete, the alert icon on image tab will be deleted : After this, do the same thing with the flavor. When an ID is set, the number of template is updated : More informations for the PaaS template of cloudify 2 or cloudify 3 can be found on her specific documentation.

The instance can be launched wherever you want, but make sure to have access to the REST API’s URL, which will be needed later on. Setup Make sure you have installed a Java JDK 1.6 or higher and set your JAVA_HOME properly. The recommended version is JDK 7u45 Download and unzip the Cloudify distribution file. Now for this driver to work, you have to customize your instaled Cloudify. Custom events In order to handle Cloudify lifecycle events, and to emit our own events, we need the alien4cloud-cloudify-custom-events . This provides a REST API and uses the Gigaspace management space to store the events. Download the zip archive and unzip it into the folder of your prefered cloud driver (e.g. gigaspaces-cloudify-2.7.0-ga/clouds/openstack-havana ) 1.0.0 If working with a secured manager: create a file events.properties and place it either next or into the events folder Edit it with the following entries (replace “cdfy_username” and “cdfy_password” by proper values): cloudUsername = <cdfy_username> cloudPassword = <cdfy_password> In the upload folder, edit the bootstrap-management.sh : Locate the line cat < ( crontab -l ) < ( echo \"@reboot export EXT_JAVA_OPTIONS=$EXT_JAVA_OPTIONS; nohup ~/gigaspaces/tools/cli/cloudify.sh $START_COMMAND $START_COMMAND_ARGS\" ) | crontab - Right after that line, add the following snippet if [ \"$GSA_MODE\" = \"lus\" ] ; then exportJavaHome = \"\" if [ ! -z ${ JAVA_HOME } ] ; then exportJavaHome = \"export JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME}; \" fi cat < ( crontab -l ) < ( echo \"@reboot ${exportJavaHome} export LUS_IP_ADDRESS=$LUS_IP_ADDRESS; chmod +x ${WORKING_HOME_DIRECTORY}/events/bin/gsDeployEventsWar.sh; nohup ${WORKING_HOME_DIRECTORY}/events/bin/gsDeployEventsWar.sh\" ) | crontab - fi Locate the line ./cloudify.sh $START_COMMAND $START_COMMAND_ARGS Right after that line, add the following snippet if [ \"$GSA_MODE\" = \"lus\" ] ; then EVENTS_PATH = \"${WORKING_HOME_DIRECTORY}/..\" chmod +x ${ EVENTS_PATH } /events/bin/gsDeployEventsWar.sh ${ EVENTS_PATH } /events/bin/gsDeployEventsWar.sh fi A command tree on your cloud folder should look like this: The <cdfy_username> and <cdfy_password> are the credentials to provide to the custom events application, used to connect via REST API to the manager. Make sure to provide good credentials if working with a secured manager. If not, they are optional. Persistence If you want to use cloudify in a persistent mode, you should override the cloulify management space: in the configure section of your cloud (in the .groovy cloud configuration file)), set a value for the property persistentStoragePath cloud { name = \"your_cloud_name\" ... configuration { ... //for persistence of management space persistentStoragePath \"path/to/persist/data\" } } Under the upload folder of your prefered cloud driver, create (if not exists) the path cloudify-overrides/tools/management-space Download the custom management space jar and store it into the newly created folder. Rename it if needed into management-space.jar . High Availability (HA) Alien4Cloud has a feature which will allow him to manage HA deploiements: deploy an application on a cloud, but in more than one availability zone (AZ). Currently, it is not possible to generate cloudify compute templates customized with a particular AZ. Thus, you’ll have to defined them explicetelly in the cloudCompute templates section of your cloud configuration file. First of all, you should make an inventory of all the AZ you want to be managed. Then, For every template defined in the cloudCompute section of of your cloud, define a HA equivalent for every managed AZ. To do so: copy & paste the template definition rename it following the pattern: _<TEMPLATE_NAME>_AZ_<AZ_name> modify (or add if not yet) the property “locationId” and set its value to the name of the AZ. At the end of the operation, given you have n cloudify templates and m AZ to manage, you shoud have n + (n x m) entries in the cloudCompute templates section. Exemple : with a template SMALL_LINUX and two AZ zone1 and zone2, we hould end up with 3 templates entries: cloud { name = \"your_cloud_name\" ... cloudCompute { templates ([ SMALL_LINUX : computeTemplate { ... }, _SMALL_LINUX_AZ_zone1 : computeTemplate { ... locationId zone1 ... }, _SMALL_LINUX_AZ - zone2 : computeTemplate { ... locationId zone2 ... } ]) } } Bootstraping Bootstrap your cloud, and when done, note the REST API URL (Rest service bellow) Rest service is avalaible at: http://management_ip:8100 Webui service is avalaible at: http://management_ip:8099 Typing http://management_ip:8081/events/test in a web browser should display the message : is running Now that you have a JAVA_HOME set and a customized running instance of Cloudify, you can move to the next step, how to install and configure the driver . If you want to use the provider’s blockStorage feature, in addition to the storage configuration of you cloud, you must make sure to have the property privileged true in all of your compute templates’ definitions.

This section is not dedicated to users of the plugin but to developers who have created Cloudify 3 plugins and want to integrate them with Alien 4 Cloud. Adding a new location type When defining a cloudify 3 plugin to support a new location type (openstack, azure, amazon etc.) users will define their types, for example the official openstack plugin defines the following types (amongst others): - cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server - cloudify.openstack.nodes.FloatingIP - cloudify.openstack.nodes.Network - cloudify.openstack.nodes.Subnet - cloudify.openstack.nodes.Volume In order to integrate these types with alien 4 cloud two solutions exists: - Map them to normative types so a normative topology can be configured. - Map them to pure cloudify types (this solution is actually not supported by Alien 4 Cloud official cloudify 3 plugin) Define location types into Alien 4 Cloud Define mapping rules from TOSCA types to Location types Define mapping rules from Location Types to the cloudify types DSL mapping Mapping of types from tosca nodes to the cloudify dsl is done through velocity. When the type exposed to the tosca world is matching the same definition as the one in the cloudify world mapping is straightforward and it is possible to use the generic mapping: For more advanced mapping (properties getting placed elseware etc.) you can use a more advanced mapping by providing your own velocity template. It is even possible to map a single node from TOSCA into multiple nodes in cloudify. For example the tosca.nodes.Network type can be mapped to various definitions: Attributes mapping In cloudify all attributes are actually runtime properties. Some naming in cloudify are not the same as in the TOSCA world. Cloudify 3 plugin allows mapping of the attributes so they match the required TOSCA normative naming. In order to do so developer of a location can add some attribute mapping in a TOSCA way when they define the location types. Theses attributes will be reused by cloudify 3 plugin to generate mapping code.

Clouds are used to describe a logical deployment target that offers a set of resources (e.g. machines, storage, network, firewalls etc.). A cloud may refer to a real cloud , to a specific tenant on a cloud , to a set of physical machines (BYON), or even docker containers. You can create and configure as many clouds as you like to have as many deployment targets (environments) as required. For example a cloud can refer to an Amazon configuration using a specific account while another cloud could be configured to work on a specific Tenant on an OpenStack cloud. To make it simple a cloud is a logical set of available resources that Alien 4 Cloud can use to deploy applications. In order to do so A4C relies on orchestration technologies that are easily pluggable. Note We are currently supporting the opensource orchestrators cloudify 2 and cloudify 3 (Full re-written engine with new DSL - much better and flexible but that we felt prior to the up-comming 3.2 a bit light for production use).

For example, in YAML, this allows defining reusable YAML macros (i.e., YAML alias anchors) for use throughout the TOSCA Service Template. node_types no This section contains a set of node type definitions for use in service templates. Such type definitions may be used within the node_templates section of the same file, or a TOSCA Definitions file may also just contain node type definitions for use in other files. relationship_types no This section contains a set of relationship type definitions for use in service templates.

Such type definitions may be used within the same file, or a TOSCA Definitions file may also just contain capability type definitions for use in other files. topology_template no Defines the topology template of an application or service, consisting of node templates that represent the application’s or service’s components, as well as relationship templates representing relations between the components. (*) In Alien 4 Cloud the template name and versions are required as we supports versioning of the templates and indexing of elements in a catalog. In TOSCA specification they are optional. Grammar The overall structure of a TOSCA Service Template and its top-level key collations using the TOSCA Simple Profile is shown below: tosca_definitions_version : # Required TOSCA Definitions version string tosca_default_namespace : # Optional. default namespace (schema, types version) template_name : # Optional name of this service template template_author : # Optional author of this service template template_version : # Optional version of this service template description : A short description of the definitions inside the file. imports : # list of import statements for importing other definitions files dsl_definitions : # list of YAML alias anchors (or macros) node_types : # list of node type definitions capability_types : # list of capability type definitions relationship_types : # list of relationship type definitions artifact_types : # list of artifact type definitions topology_template : # Topology template definition tosca_definitions_version This required element provides a means to include a reference to the TOSCA Simple Profile specification within the TOSCA Definitions YAML file. It is an indicator for the version of the TOSCA grammar that should be used to parse the remainder of the document. Keyword tosca_definitions_version Grammar tosca_definitions_version : <tosca_simple_profile_version> Examples: TOSCA Simple Profile version 1.0 specification using the defined namespace alias: tosca_definitions_version : tosca_simple_yaml_1_0_0 TOSCA Simple Profile version 1.0 specification using the fully defined (target) namespace: tosca_definitions_version : http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/simple/1.0 template_name This optional element declares the optional name of service template as a single-line string value. Keyword template_name Grammar template_name : <name string> Example template_name : My service template Notes Some service templates are designed to be referenced and reused by other service templates. Therefore, in these cases, the template_name value SHOULD be designed to be used as a unique identifier through the use of namespacing techniques. template_author This optional element declares the optional author(s) of the service template as a single-line string value. Keyword template_author #### Grammar template_author : <author string> Example template_author : My service template template_version This element declares the optional version of the service template as a single-line string value. Grammar template_version : <version> Example template_version : 2.0.17 Some service templates are designed to be referenced and reused by other service templates and have a lifecycle of their own. Therefore, in these cases, a template_version value SHOULD be included and used in conjunction with a unique template_name value to enable lifecycle management of the service template and its contents. description This optional element provides a means to include single or multiline descriptions within a TOSCA Simple Profile template as a scalar string value. imports This optional element provides a way to import a block sequence of one or more TOSCA Definitions documents. TOSCA Definitions documents can contain reusable TOSCA type definitions (e.g., Node Types, Relationship Types, Artifact Types, etc.) defined by other authors. This mechanism provides an effective way for companies and organizations to define normative types and/or describe their software applications for reuse in other TOSCA Service Templates. In Alien 4 Cloud you can import libraries from the repository instead of having to package every required elements within your archives. This also allows a better management of versioning and dependencies. In order to support this scenario the import element supports an additional non-normative definition. Of course when you export artifacts from Alien 4 Cloud you can ask Alien 4 Cloud to export a pure normative package (Alien will package all elements required together in a single archive and use normative relative imports).

The goal of this guide is not to provide an extensive cover of all the functionalities. Prerequisites Cloudify Manager 3.3.1: This getting started will leverage the cloudify 3 plugin and as such a running cloudify manager is required before moving forward. In order to install it please follow Cloudify documentation to install the cloudify CLI and install a manager A machine with Linux or MacOS Operating System: Alien4Cloud can run on windows OS too but we recommend Unix based OS. Moreover the default package only includes sh script. JAVA: Ensure that you have at least JAVA version 7 or higher installed on your working station. If not, just install java following instructions here . Access to a supported Cloud: This getting started guide is made for Amazon EC2 but can be adapted easily to run on other supported platforms. A supported web browser (check versions here ). Install Alien4Cloud Download Alien4Cloud distribution package alien4cloud-dist and extract the archive it in your desired location. Once extracted you should have the following content: ├── alien4cloud-ui-1.1.0.war ├── alien4cloud.sh ├── config │   └── alien4cloud-config.yml │   └── elasticsearch.yml │   └── log4j.properties ├── init │   └── archives │   │ └── alien-tosca-normative-types.zip │   │ └── alien-xtended-storage-types.zip │   │ plugins │   │ └── alien4cloud-cloudify3-provider-1.1.0.zip Start Alien4Cloud In order to start Alien4Cloud just open a terminal inside the extracted root directory (alien4cloud) and run the alien4cloud.sh script. ./alien4cloud.sh The application should be available at the url http://<alien4cloud_host_ip>:<port> (the default port is 8088). For example, if you are running Alien4Cloud on local, it should be available on http://localhost:8088 . You should see the authentication splash screen : Login into the application using the default user: user: admin password: admin The admin user is granted will all rights on the platform. This getting started will perform all operations using the admin user. Of course if you want to setup an Alien4Cloud for production usage and multi-users and rôle management you should probably refer to advanced configurations and installation of Alien4Cloud as well as user guide for user management . Configure your orchestrator and location Create and configure an orchestrator Now that we are logged in Alien4Cloud we must define a location (where we will actually deploy applications). In Alien4Cloud every location is managed by an orchestrator. To create an orchestrator, go to and in the sub-menu. Create an orchestrator named Cloudify3 with the plugin Cloudify 3 Orchestrator : 1.1.0 . At this moment your orchestrator is create but not enable. Click on your orchestrator to see the informations page, and then click on the configuration menu icon . In the Driver configuration part, add the URL of your manager and return to the previous page to enable your orchestrator. An error can occur at this moment if Alien4Cloud cannot access to your manager. Make sure that your manager is properly bootstrap. Create and configure a location Once your orchestrator is created and enabled, go to the locations page by clicking on . Create a location named AWS and select amazon on the infrastructure type drop-down. The details page of your location should appears. Go to and add the following resources: alien.nodes.aws.PublicNetwork alien.cloudify.aws.nodes.Compute The network resource doesn’t need a specific configuration. Click on the compute and set the image_id to ami-47a23a30 and the instance_type to t2.medium . The image_id is the ID of a public Ubuntu image on the AWS eu-west zone. Any Ubuntu 14.04 or later should work with this topology. Alien4Cloud supports GNU/Linux and Windows images, the choice of the image depends on your components requirements. Import components in Alien4Cloud The Wordpress topology is using custom types, we have to upload them first. Find those types on github here : https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples apache : the webserver here php : the php interperter here mysql : the database required by Wordpress here wordpress : the blog component here topology-wordpress : the topology composed by previous components here The quickest way to import all of these archives is the Git integration feature in Alien4Cloud. Click on button in the navigation bar. Then click side bar sub-menu . Now add a new Git location: . Fill the modal like the example below and . Now, click on to pull all components from git and upload them into the Alien4Cloud catalog. Find detailed informations about the Wordpress topology in the devops guide . Create a Wordpress application Now we have the Wordpress template ready to use, we can create an application based on it. To do this, go to section. Click on button and select the wordpress-template in the topology template drop-down and the 1.1.0-SNAPHOT version in Topology template . The application creation should redirect you on the application informations page. To see your application topology, go to page, you will see the following screen. Setup and deploy your application To deploy this new application, go on sub-menu and : Select your location Select the os_arch of your computes And click on To understand all configuration available for the deployment page, please refer to the application management section . In this part, you will be able to check location resources matching and possible errors. This should not happen if your orchestrator and location are well configured. If you need help regarding their configuration, please refer to this section . Check that your application is up and running On the runtime view, you can have the detailed deployment progress. Click on the side bar sub-menu , When all nodes are deployed, go back in the sub-menu to get the Wordpress application url and test it ! And voilà !

The second guide will explain how to take in charge Alien in details and configure it for your uses. Important: security issue Alien used a version of ElasticSearch concern by a security issue. To prevent an attack, make sure to secure the port of ES (9200 as default). 1. Prerequisites: Download and install VirtualBox (Working with version >= 4.3.26) Download and install Vagrant (Working with version >= 1.7.2) Install triggers plugin for Vagrant: vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers (Working with version >= 0.5.0) An active AWS account. Make sure you have all the account informations we will need later (user key, access key, key file and key pair) 2. VM Automated Install: Download and unzip the package vm-alien4cloud-1.0.0 (for other version, see on the page footer). As a result, a subdirectory vm-alien4cloud should be created Copy your .pem file to the directory vm-alien4cloud/vm/key Edit the file vm-alien4cloud/puppet/manifests/install.pp and set your aws “user key” and “access key” ( user and apiKey parameters), key file name and key pair ( keyFile and keyPair parameters) and finally change machineNamePrefix and managementGroup . Change your working directory: cd vm-alien4cloud/vm/centos-6 Execute the following command to build a new VM: vagrant up At the first run, vagrant will download the base box which will be used to create the alien4cloud VM, then provision the VM with Puppet. The time needed to create a VM is around 30 minutes and depends on your internet connection speed. At the end of the installation, you’ll see a message ==> alien4cloud: Notice: Finished catalog run in 1648.89 seconds . You can then access Alien4Cloud Web interface from a browser on the following address: http://192.168.32.10:8088 . Use the default account admin with the password admin to login into Alien. 3. Deploy your application: To deploy this new application, just go on Applications > Deployments submenu. Zone A : Select an environment and a cloud Keep the default environment Environment and select your cloud OpenStackCloud created above. Zone B : Provider properties Those properties depends on the provider implementation. You usualy have default settings. Zone C : Topology required settings Those basic settings are required for Compute nodes. Zone D : Cloud resources matching In this part, you will be able to check matching cloud resources and possible matching errors. This should not happen if your cloud is well configured. 4. Check that your application is up and running: Runtime view: On this submenu view Application > Runtime , you can have the detailed deployment progress. Wordpress url Go back in the Application > Informations submenu to get the Wordpress application url and test it ! And voilà ! 5. How to Uninstall: If you would like to de-provision the VM and the associated cloud created by Alien4Cloud, just execute the following commands: Change your working directory: cd vm-alien4cloud/vm/centos-6 Run the following command: vagrant destroy Older versions: vm-alien4cloud-1.0.0-RC1 vm-alien4cloud-SM23 vm-alien4cloud-SM24 vm-alien4cloud-SM25 vm-alien4cloud-SM26 vm-alien4cloud-SM27 1. Prerequisites: Ensure that you have at least JAVA version 7 or higher installed on your working station. If not, just install java following instructions here . You can get Cloudify in version : 2.7.1 here . 3.2 here . In order to start using alien 4 cloud you have to download Alien. Two versions are available : standalone : starts an embedded jetty server deployable : war file that can be deployed within a war container We recommend using the Alien standalone with Cloudify 2.7.1. 2. Check your access to a cloud: To try Alien 4 Cloud with provider plugin Cloudify 2.x or 3.x you will need a cloud ready to use with your credentials. If not, we advice you to use trystack , a personal an free to use OpenStack. For this tutorial we recommend to use OpenStack. 3. Configure and start Cloudify: Regarding your choice between providers for Cloudify 2 or 3, please refer to those following sections : Configure and start Cloudify 2 Configure and start Cloudify 3 4. Start and configure Alien 4 Cloud : Assuming you have downloaded the standalone version in the prerequisite step you will only have to execute the following command in your shell : java -XX:MaxPermSize = 512m -jar alien4cloud-ui-VERSION-standalone.war --spring.profiles.active = security-demo The command option --spring.profiles.active=security-demo allows you to have Alien 4 Cloud started with default settings such as the default user admin we will use later. 5. Check that Alien4Cloud is working : After connecting via your browser (for standalone version, default port is 8088 on the machine hosting A4C), you should see the following Authentication splash screen 6. Install and configure provider plugin: In this step, you will have to import the chosen provider plugin and then configure it. Refer to the following sections : Cloudify 2 plugin Cloudify 3 plugin In our tutorial, let’s call the configured cloud OpenStackCloud . 7. Import components in Alien 4 Cloud: Regardless the used provider, read the following section to know how to import your components archive : import components Normative types The TOSCA specification used by Alien 4 Cloud is defining normative types . As a language, you can use those components as is or extend it to suit to your needs. You can find our implementation for these types on github here : normative types on github This download link will provide a zip with a subfolder. Ensure that this subfolder doest not exist or the component upload will fail. You must have a zip with this file tree : ├── images │   ├── compute.png │   ├── loadbalancer.png │   ├── network.png │   ├── objectstore.png │   ├── relational_db.png │   ├── root.png │   ├── router.png │   ├── software.png │   └── volume.png ├── normative-types.yml └── README.md Required types for Wordpress The Wordpress topology is using custom types, we have to upload them first. Find those types on github here : samples repository apache : the webserver here php : the php interperter here mysql : the database required by Wordpress here wordpress : the blog component here Zip the content of each folder like you did for normative types and upload each zipped file in this order. Wordpress topology In order to have an full application ready to deploy through Alien 4 Cloud, just download the yaml description of the topology here : Wordpress topology . When you have this file, zip it, then you will be able to import it into Alien 4 Cloud as an topology template . Find detailed informations about the wordpress topology here . 7. Create an Wordpress application: Now we have the Wordpress template ready to use, we can create an application based on it : The application creation should redirect you on the Application > Informations page. 8. Setup and deploy your application: To deploy this new application, just go on Applications > Deployments submenu.

A TOSCA container can then deploy the declared topology on a cloud and orchestrated it.

This section gives a focus to Cloudify 3 orchestrator plugin for ALIEN, a plugin to manage deployment on various cloud using Cloudify 3.x . Alien 4 Cloud Cloudify 3 Support The alien 4 cloud plugin for cloudify 3 exposes several nodes so that TOSCA templates can be deployed on Cloudify 3 to various locations. This allows full portability of topologies (or blueprints) that you have designed. The following tables shows the supported features of our plugin on the various clouds and how they are mapped to TOSCA. OpenStack Amazon Policies support in cloudify 3 Cloudify 3 currently manages the deployment and un-deployment of blueprints and support the ability to trigger custom workflows that have been shipped within the blueprint at runtime. Out of the box cloudify 3.3 doesn’t support policies like auto-healing and have a very limited support for Scalability that causes issues in various scenarios. Note that Cloudify guys are working on 3.4 that should provide much better support for both HA and Scalability concern. Auto-healing As stated previously cloudify 3.3 doesn’t provide support for auto-healing of services. It provide a basic monitoring feature that we implement in the blueprint we generate from the TOSCA model. This basic monitoring is based on Machine status and not software status meaning that if one of the software in a blueprint crash it won’t be detected by the cloudify 3. We developed as part of Alien 4 Cloud the ability to generate a cron-based mecanism that check the monitoring data in order to trigger an auto-healing workflow. This implementation is quite naïve for now and is disabled by default on deployments but can be enabled per deployment through an orchestrator property. Scalability Scalability behavior is currently not deeply specified in TOSCA and Cloudify has a very simple implementation of scalability management that treats only two kind of relationships, hosted_on (1-1 relationship) and all others (1-n relationships). When scaling a node, all nodes that are hosted_on the given node are scaled, however nodes that are connected or attached to it are not, this includes block-storage and floating ips which is not a correct implementation for most of situations. We have designed a workaround to change this behavior so that it is possible to scale a node with BlockStorage and Floating IP. This workaround relies on both some updates on alien4cloud blueprint generation and workflow management for cloudify but also on an update of the cloudify plugin so that Compute, BlockStorage and FloatingIPs are considered as a single Compute node in cloudify world with optional list of block storage and floating ips that will be managed per instance. There is currently some missing details in the TOSCA specification on how relationships can be impacted in scaling scenarios and we are working with bot Cloudify and TOSCA to enhance the specification. Setup The provider plugin embeds the cloudify opentack plugin that contains this workaround. To be sure you’re deployments will use this plugin rather than the original one, just ensure that the import settings for your orchestrator (location openstack) contains openstack-plugin.yaml rather than http://www.getcloudify.org/spec/openstack-plugin/1.3.1/plugin.yaml . You’ll also need to execute the following operations on the cloudify manager: sudo yum install gcc sudo yum install python-devel IaaS limitations The workaround mentioned above has only been developed for OpenStack. This means that for Amazon for example, you will be able to scale a compute, but if it is attached to a public network, only one of them will have a floating IP attachment. Here is a table that shows the limitations about scaling per IaaS:   OpenStack Amazon BYON Single Compute OK OK OK Compute + Network + Block Storage OK KO N/A Block storage recovery limitation Block storage recovery is the ability to reuse an already created block storage. Imagine you have a topology containing a compute with a block storage attached on it. You deploy the topology, the VM is started, the block storage is provisionned and attached to the VM, and then some process write data to the disk. If you don’t use a DeletableBlockStorage , this means that you want the data written to the disk to be persistent : if the topology is undeployed then deployed again, you want the block storage to be reused. To manage such feature, A4C will keep a trace of the volume ID and store it in the deployment topology. When the topology is deployed again, this volume id is used to find the volume in the the IaaS rather than provisoning another one. We still have some issues about block storage recovery : the component LinuxFileSystem will not manage recovery in case of runtime scaling.

As Plugin for this orchestrator, make sure to select Cloudify 3 Orchestrator from the list. Validate. Configuring the orchestrator On the orchestrator list, select and click on the newly created orchestrator, follow these steps to configure your orchestrator: Connection Configuration : Click on the Configuration link to configure connection to your bootstrapped cloudify’s manager. In the Driver configuration section, change the URL to use the correct IP of your manager that you obtained after the bootstrap operation. If your manager is secured, you can configure the admin credentials, the disableSslVerification option should only be set to true for testing purpose, it will disable all certificate validation for SSL. Enable Orchestrator : You can then switch back to the Information tab and enable the orchestrator by clicking on the Enable orchestrator button. If the orchestrator is not enabled, please check Alien’s log to have details on the error, it might be a bad configuration (bad connection url, bad user/password, invalid certificate etc…) Locations : An orchestrator can manage multiple locations, for example, you can have the same orchestrator which manages your local cloud and your public cloud. It is possible for the same deployment to span on multiple locations. For the moment cloudify 3 only supports single location, so we can only have 1 location per cloudify 3 orchestrator. Click on New Location , in the popup, enter the name of your location and its type. Configuration Resources : The configuration resources are not real IAAS resources as such. In general they are configurations for other resources. Choose the type of your resource, then click on Add to create a new one In this example, you have a configuration resource of type Image on an OpenStack location, you can describe here the details of the image, such as os type (linux, windows …), distribution(Ubuntu, CentOS …), which must correspond to what you have on your IAAS. The same thing can be done for the types flavor and availability zone. On Demand Resources : On demand resources are real IAAS resources that can be used to replace abstract resources in a topology. Click on Auto-config to generate on demand resources from precedent configuration resources. As you can see below, with the Image Ubuntu and the Flavor Medium, Alien generated a Compute template Medium_Ubuntu You can always configure your resources (in this case compute) without using the Auto-config functionality. To create resources that cannot be auto-configured (such as volume or network or non auto-configured compute etc …), choose the type of the resource, then click on Add .

Block Storages Configuration : Here you have to create/configure your cloud’s block storage templates. Map your cloud’s created block storage to the correct IaaS identifier if you want to reuse existing resource. Congratulation!! You’ve finished to configure your cloudify3-based cloud.

Supported lifecycles events This provider does not yet support the implementation of all of the Cloudify livecycle events, but it is constantly evolving. The events supported are: Archive Interface operation Standard install (as create ), start , stop fastconnect.cloudify.extensions startDetection (as start_detection ), StopDetection (as stop_detection ), locator Note that the driver only supports groovy scripts for the fastconnect.cloudify.extensions interface’s operations. Also, you must be aware that the routine will be executed as a goovy closure. Therefore, you MUST NOT use the ServiceContextFactory class to get the service context, it has been injected automatically so that you can directly use it via the variable context . Example: interfaces : [ ... ] fastconnect.cloudify.extensions : start_detection : scripts/tomcat_startDetection.groovy stop_detection : scripts/tomcat_stopDetection.groovy locator : scripts/alien_tomcat_locator.groovy startDetection You can provide a start detection routine, and it should be written in a groovy file, and must return a boolean: True if the routine ended well, and false if not. The routine will be executed as a Cloudify closure, in the service descriptor file. Therefore, as stated in the Cloudify documentation, you shouldn’t use the ServiceContextFactory class to get the service context. The context has been injected automatically so that you can directly use it via the variable context . Example: def config = new ConfigSlurper (). parse ( new File ( \"${context.serviceDirectory}/scripts/tomcat-service.properties\" ). toURL ()) def result = ServiceUtils . arePortsOccupied ([ config . port , config . ajpPort ]) return result stopDetection Similar to the case of start detection, written in a groovy file, the stopDetection routine will be executed as a closure must and return a boolean value.

Requirements Alien 4 cloud is not responsible for actual deployment orchestration but rather interact with existing orchestration technologies. In order to define an orchestrator and a location, you must configure plugins that will be used to actually perform deployment(s) on the defined location using the created orchestrator. In order to configure a set of Orchestrator/locations, you must have installed an orchestrator plugin first see plugin management . Supported orchestrators We are currently supporting the opensource orchestrator cloudify 3.3.1. Orchestrators management Orchestrator creation Once you have installed a plugin, the admin can go on the orchestrator page and configure one. Remember that you can use the Alien 4 Cloud contextual help in order to be guided directly within the application. To create an orchestrator, just go in the orchestrator list page and click on the New orchestrator button. Orchestrator configuration To configure an orchestrator, select it in the orchestrator list page and go to configuration side menu. Naming policy On every orchestrator, you can configure a naming policy that Alien 4 Cloud will use when deploying an application. The naming policy will be used to identify the deployment on the cloud’s orchestrator. Most of the orchestrators will leverage this naming policy to name the resources used at the IaaS level also. To compose your own application naming policy, you can use the following entities and properties : environment : the environment linked to the deployment id name description environmentType : OTHER, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION_TESTS, USER_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS, PRE_PRODUCTION, PRODUCTION application : deployed application id name creationDate lastUpdateDate metaProperties [‘PROPERTY_NAME’] : meta-properties defined on the application time : current date at format yyyyMMddHHmm The default naming policy setting for any orchestrator is : environment.name + application.name Deployment name unicity The deployment name must be unique at a given time, the orchestrator administrator is responsible for choosing a pattern that should be unique or some application(s) may not be deployed (if a deployment with the same name is already running). Note that we guaranty that an application’s name is unique across all applications and that an environment name is unique for a given application. However, when generating the application paaSId (final application name on the PaaS), all space character will be replaced by an _ . Therefore and as an example, if your naming policy involves the application name, you can not deploy simultaneously two applications named “ Test App ” and “ Test_App ” with the same orchestrator, as the generated paaSId will be in conflict. The main pattern to define a naming policy is to use + to concat different properties or text, for examples : environment.name + application.name + time application.id + environment.environmentType + '-US_ZONE' time + '__' + application.creationDate 'MY_APP' + '-WORDPRESS-' + time metaProperties['PROPERTY_NAME'] + '-' + time Empty meta properties Any empty property used in the naming policy expression will cause a deployment failure. Advanced use : the policy expression is based on SpEL ( Spring Expression Language ) and you could use its capabilities if you are familiar with it. Note : do not use the # Driver configuration Most orchestrator plugins will require specific configuration in order to communicate with the actual orchestrator instance or to configure it’s behavior. As stated, this configuration being specific to the orchestrator, you should refer to the orchestrator specific guide. For example, the cloudify3 provider defines connexion parameters so that Alien 4 Cloud can communicate with the orchestrator engine server (cloudify 3 manager). More informations for cloudify 3 can be found on her specific documentation. Updating configuration Usually, the configuration of an orchestrator is done before enabling it. The configuration is automatically saved in that case. However, it might occur that you want to update it after having the orchestrator enabled. Therefore, you need to unlock the configuration first, by hitting the unlock button on the top right corner of the configuration screen. Do not forget to hit the save button on the bottom of the screen, to save the configuration, and it will be loaded immediately. Enabling the orchestrator Once properly configured, you should enable the orchestrator, by hitting the enable button on the information screen of the selected orchestration. Locations management After Configuring the orchestrator, you have to create one or more location, depending on whether your orchestrator allows it. Note that you cannot access the location management steps on a disabled orchestrator. Location creation To create a location, first go to the location the orchestrator list page, by clicking on the side menu represented by a cloud, and then click on the New location button, and fill in the form. Location configuration Once created you must configure the location. It requires several steps: Configure cloud resources used for resources matching at deployment time. Configure the meta properties of the orchestrator (that depends of the chosen one). Configure the security access to the location Configure location resources Configuration resources tab In this step you need to configure the resources types exposed by location. These resources will help to configure or generate those which will be used in matching on deployment configuration. For example, the Cloudify 3 provider exposes configuration resources such as Images, Favors, and Availability zone. On demand resources tab On demand resources are the exact resources used for matching nodes within the topology before deploying, such as Computes, networks and volumes. They may a combination of one or more configuration resources. (Example, the on demand resource Compute could be a combination of Image and Flavor configuration resources.). The following is an example based on the Cloudify 3 provider: Auto configuration If the location exposes a way to automatically generate on-demand resources, you can hit the “auto-config” button to auto-generate them. Meta properties This feature allows you to define meta-properties on your location and then use them in your topology as an internal variable defined by your administrator. Obviously as a CLOUD_DELOYER , APPLICATION_USER or APPLICATION_MANAGER you won’t be able to change this value. At this stage, we assume you know how to create meta-properties targeting location, application or environment. In the meta-properties tab, you should be able to set a value for any location targeted meta-property. Fill the desired values in order to use it later as in get_input for a property. Regarding your meta-property definition, you can add constraint on it. Thus, you must see constraint violation error if any in this location meta-properties form. Security and roles On the security section, you can decide who (as user or group) have the right to deploy an application on the location.

TODO Interface to implement TODO Orchestrator and Locations Writing a plugin requires to be familiar with Alien 4 Cloud concepts. As you know an orchestrator instance in alien 4 cloud is supposed to connect to an orchestrator engine. This orchestrator engine may be able to support deployments on one or multiple locations. Some orchestrator implementations like the current cloudify implementation can only manage an deploy to a single location. Some other like brooklyn allows the configuration of multiple locations for a single orchestrator. Every location has a location type, the plugin is responsible for exposing the different supported types. This is done by implementing the plugin interface method TODO Method to be implemented TODO Definition of supported types. The plugin may support normative types or just support it’s own specific types. If so it won’t be able to deploy TOSCA topologies but only specific topologies that will loose the portability of the normative TOSCA.

"},{"title":"Orchestrators and locations","baseurl":"","url":"/documentation/1.1.0/concepts/orchestrators_locations.html","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Orchestrator and locations are the fundamental concepts that allows alien 4 cloud to bring deployment’s portability across various technologies (orchestrators) and targets (locations). Orchestrators An orchestrator is a deployment technology that will orchestrate (and eventually maintain) the deployment and undeployment of a topology. There is various orchestrators on the market and Alien 4 Cloud can easily integrate with them through a plugin mechanism. Every deployment in alien 4 cloud is done through an orchestrator on a Location configured for and managed by an orchestrator . Locations In Alien 4 Cloud every deployment is done on what we call a Location . Locations are used to describe a logical deployment target that offers a set of resources (e.g. machines, storage, network, firewalls etc.). A location may refer to a cloud , to a specific tenant on a cloud , to a set of physical machines (BYON), or even docker containers. For example a location can refer to an Amazon configuration using a specific account while another location could be configured to work on a specific Tenant on an OpenStack cloud. To make it simple a location is a logical set of available resources that Alien 4 Cloud can use to deploy applications. In order to do so A4C relies on orchestration technologies that are easily pluggable. You can create and configure as many locations as you like to have as many deployment targets (environments) as required. Location’s supported resources As we stated a location may refer to some very different targets from clouds to containers or physical machines. This means that you may have differences in the resources supported by theses locations. More the configuration of this resources may not be the same from one location to another. Alien 4 Cloud has been designed to allow portability of a given application or to be precise to a given topology to deploy. However we never wanted to limit the user because of portability. The location’s defined resources are there exactly for this purpose. Every location now exposes their own and specific definitions of the generic components (or nodes) that lies into TOSCA. They can also expose some components that are not at all in relation with the normative nodes so people can choose to create non-portable topologies if they feel that they will get more benefits from it that portability. We really wanted in 1.1.0 to provide user with flexibility and ability to benefits from the best of orchestrator technologies. Here a list of supported resources with Cloudify 3: Infrastructure type OS type Supported artifact OpenStack linux .sh ( tosca.artifacts.ShellScript )   windows .bat ( alien.artifacts.BatchScript ) AWS linux .sh ( tosca.artifacts.ShellScript )   windows .bat ( alien.artifacts.BatchScript ) Some Alien users deployed also Puppet artifact through grooving script. Note We are currently supporting the opensource orchestrators cloudify 3 but are also working in collaboration with Apache Brooklyn on an orchestration plugin currently in incubation state. Role and security Only a user with the global ADMIN role can define, configure, enable and grant deployment role to other users or groups on a locations. To find more on locations and how to configure them in Alien 4 Cloud please look at the Getting started guide if you don’t already have an Alien instance running and at the cloud setup guide in order to learn cloud configuration.

The lib folder (optional) must contain all java archives (jar) required for the plugin to run. They will be added to the plugin classloader. Of course you should not add ALIEN 4 cloud jars here as they will be loaded through the plugin parent classloader. META-INF/plugin.yml contains the plugin description and entry point informations (the plugin descriptor). The ui folder contains all ui elements including javascript files, css html and any other static files. ├── javapackage │   ├── MyClass.class │   └── ... ├── lib │   └── library.jar ├── META-INF │   └── plugin.yml ├── ui │   └── scripts │   │ └── plugin.js │   │ views │   │ └── view.html The plugin descriptor The plugin descriptor (META-INF/plugin.yml) is mandatory and is the entry point of the plugin for ALIEN. As many other configuration elements it is a YAML file that allows to describe your plugin. grammar As detailed in the architecture section, a ALIEN plugin is actually a Spring sub-context; As so it requires a Spring context configuration entry point. For ALIEN plugins we have decided to allow only java based configuration and thus a plugin must specify a configuration class in it’s descriptor. The configuration class is the only mandatory class in a plugin so it can be loaded by ALIEN. Keyname Type Required Description id string yes Identifier of the plugin. Must be unique within alien4cloud. name string yes The name of the plugin as it will be displayed to user. version string yes The version of the plugin. description no string The optional description of the plugin. configuration_class yes string The name of the java class to load as Spring context configuration (see Plugin context entry point). ui_entry_point no string Path of the javascript file of your ui plugin that should be loaded as entry point. The path must be relative to the ui folder. More details in the ui plugin section. component_descriptors no list of component_descriptor Optional list of beans that you wan’t to expose from your plugin so they will be available to other plugins. To be honest such usage is currently not really useful as we cannot yet specify loading priority or dependencies for plugins. example Plugin context entry point As described higher, a plugin in ALIEN is a spring context that inherits from ALIEN context. This allows you to build plugin that have full access to the repository or any other component in ALIEN. When loading a plugin, ALIEN for cloud will create the spring context based on the spring java configuration class defined in the plugin descriptor. It will then lookup the spring context for plugin beans matching one of a supported plugin type (like a bean that implements IPaaSProvider for example). Below is an example of a plugin spring context java configuration that acts as an entry point for the cloudify plugin. @Configuration @ComponentScan ( \"alien.paas.cloudify\" ) @ImportResource ( \"classpath:properties-config.xml\" ) public class PluginContextConfiguration { } Plugin configuration ALIEN provides an easy way to configure a plugin by generating the UI based on a configuration object using introspection. It also manages persistency of the configuration. In order to enable plugin configuration, one of the bean in your spring context must implements the IPluginConfigurator interface. This interface (see signature below) allow to provide a POJO that will act as the configuration object for the whole plugin. /** Interface for plugin configuration objects. */ public interface IPluginConfigurator < T > { /** * Get an instance of T that is the default configuration object of the plugin. * * @return A configuration object of type T. */ T getDefaultConfiguration (); /** * Set / apply a configuration for a plugin. * * @param configuration The configuration object as edited by the user. */ void setConfiguration ( T configuration ); } Current version of ALIEN 4 Cloud does not supports more than a single configuration. Thus you should make sure that a single IPluginConfigurator exists in your plugin spring context.

Topology substitution / composition A topology template can also be used in another template as a type. Topology substitution can make existing topology template re-useable. In order to do this, you must: Create a type that is inherited from your topology template. For example, you have a topology template of an Apache server hosted on a compute as shown in this view. If you want to use this template as a type, you need to click subsitution panel, which is over the bottom-right corner in topology composer view. Choose the capabilities/requirements you want to expose. After clicking Subsitutions panel, you can type tosca.nodes.Root in search bar in the panel. It will create empty Capabilities and Requirements fields. Then, you can select the components whose capabilities/requirements you want to expose. By clicking the Expose button next to capabilities/requirements element of the selected component, you can expose these capabilities/requirements, which will become the capabilities and requirements of the composed new type. Eventually define inputs and outputs that will become respectively properties and attributes for the created type. The inputs of your topology template will become properties of the composed type, and what you choose as outputs will be attributes of the new type. The created type is named like the template and is usable in another template or an application topology. It’s content will be wired at runtime stage. Topology version In the topology version page you can create, edit or delete a version. As we already say in the application concept page, if you remove the ‘SNAPSHOT’ qualifier, your topology will be not editable. Workflows A workflow defines sequences of steps that act upon topology’s nodes in order to achieve a defined goal. Each topology embed several workflows: standard workflow ( install and uninstall ) : when you are designing a topology, a4c maintains the two standard workflows (install and uninstall) following the TOSCA normative lifecycle. You can customize them in order to change the way steps are orchestrated. custom workflows: you can create as many custom workflows as you want. We can also talk about deduced workflows: these workflows are deduced from standard workflows. For example, when you scale up a host, the host node installation sub-workflow is deduced from install workflow (by isolating all steps concerning this particular host and ignoring all other hosts and links from/to steps outside this host). Workflow steps So a workflow is a set of steps that are eventually linked. Actually it’s an oriented graph. A step can have predecessors and successors. Rules are : If A is followed by B, then A will be executed before B. if A is followed by B and C, then B and C will be executed in parallel after A (fork). if C is preceded by A and B, then C will be executed only after A and B are terminated (join). if a step has no predecessors, it will be linked from the workflow entry point (start). if a step has no successors, it will be linked to the workfow end point (end). Workflow activity A step is associated to an activity. Currently, an activity can be: set state activity: this activity is used to change the state of a node. call operation activity: used to call an operation on a node interface. delegate workflow activity: this is used by a4c to specify that a particular node lifecycle managment should be handled by the orchestrator (consider it as a black box). Delegate activity and abstract nodes When you add an abstract node to a topology, a4c will add a delegate workflow activity, until you replace the node by a concrete implementation. If the node is not replaced before the deployment, it must be substituted at deployment matching stage. The lifecycle for this node will then be managed by the orchestrator. Node relationship operations When you add a node in a topology, a4c adds all the necessary steps in the standard workflows : all the operations of tosca.interfaces.node.lifecycle.Standard interface are added in the correct order. When you add a relation between two nodes, the steps concerning those two nodes are organized regarding the standard lifecycle rules described in TOSCA. For the moment, operation related to the relation are not added as steps in the workflow: they are implicit (actually, the cloudify orchestrator manages such operations at a lower level): operations pre_configure_source , post_configure_source and pre_configure_target , post_configure_target are launched around configure operation (for respectively source and target). operations add_target and add_source are launched after the start operation. operation remove_target is launched after the stop operation. Importance of state change activity As we can see in the image below, each operation call is surrounded with state changes. Here, the create operation is preceded by a state change to ‘ creating ’ and followed by a state change to ‘ created ’. This is defined by TOSCA in the standard lifecycle. This is very important to surround each standard interface operation call by these state changes and even add these state changes even if the operation is not added in the workflow. These state changes are mainly used as bound when some relationship are added in the topology. Workflow edition Editing a complex workflow can become a mess if you have a lot of nodes and relationships in your topology. We have tried to build a intuitive editor to help you to customize your workflows. Basic usage rules are: the first time you click on a step, it’s spinned (and becomes blue). The spinned step is the one on whitch you will be able to make some actions. All possible actions on the spinned step are listed in the panel at the right of the screen. In the image above, we have selected the step named ‘create’ (apache create operation) and we are about to insert an operation call. when a step is spinned, when you click again on other steps, you will add them to the selection (yellow background). Then you will be able to make actions between the spinned step and the selected steps. In the image below, we are adding a link between the apache.create and the php.create When you edit a workflow, some validation are checked and some errors can be raised: cycle are avoided. state changes are not allowed in parallel for a given node. state changes must follow a defined order (typically started can not be set before created). In the image above, a cycle is detected and an error is raised. Some actions are not allowed: you can not remove/add state change activity steps in standard workflows. you can not remove delegate activity steps in standard workflows. you can not add any activity for an abstract node. Workflow limitations Topology composition Custom workflows are not compatible with topology composition: when you use topology composition (when you add a node of a type that is a result of a template exposition), all your customizations will be lost (the standard workflow will be regenerated).

Node operation For node operation script, the following variables are available: NODE : the node name. INSTANCE : the unique instance ID. INSTANCES : A comma separated list of all available instance IDs. HOST : the node name of the node that host the current one. Relationship operation For relationship operation script, the following variables are available: TARGET_NODE : The node name that is targeted by the relationship.

Goal: Explain how to start with component design. In this tutorial, the component we will focus on is Tomcat Application Server. Define the node type A component in ALIEN is a tosca node type. Information on TOSCA and the grammar can be found on OASIS TC pages and in ALIEN documentation in the components section. This tutorial doesn’t focus on the grammar but on the methodology to define components. The first step to define the component is to define it’s id. In our case, we will define a ‘fastconnect.nodes.Tomcat’ node. This component will be abstract as we don’t plan to include an implementation for now (another member of the team may provide an implementation). More, while an implementation may not be compliant with any Operating System (Linux shell scripts that won’t run on windows) or PaaS (Cloudify specific scripts) etc. The abstract type allows to define an agnostic view of the middleware. A same node may have different implementations, for example a Tomcat Node may have an implementation based on puppet and another based on chef, or even pure shell script. Definition of abstract types is also a good way also to provide separation of concern and to let an Architect define a middleware and let the implementation to the experts. Second step when defining a node is to find from which parent type it should extends, it can be an existing type already uploaded in ALIEN or one of TOSCA normative type . There is multiple reasons to extends from the normative types (or another type that itself extends from a normative type): Workflow automatic generation is based on the fact that the node uses the default lifecycle interfaces that are defined on the normative types. Using normative types is also a good way to leverage ALIEN 4 Cloud facet search (for example I will be able to filter on all ApplicationServer nodes). Finally extending from normative types allows to bootstrap your node with some properties, capabilities and requirements. For example as our Tomcat extends from tosca.nodes.SoftwareComponents it will have a version property that should be specified a host requirement (as a software component must be installed on a compute node). the default feature requirement and relationship that are used to established depends on relationships (to impact the lifecycle generation). In the case of a Tomcat server the normative type that we should extends from is tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer . This node extends itself from tosca.nodes.SoftwareComponents . fastconnect.nodes.Tomcat : abstract : true derived_from : tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer documentation : Tomcat application server is an application server that supports deployment of java web applications (war). It is possible here to create another parent abstract type that supports any Java Application Server. This would allow for any Java Application Server to just extends from the node and leverage common properties, requirements and capabilties (Java requirement, War capability, Java arguments properties etc.). Extension is not mandatory as this will just allow to simplify the definition of multiple bean but will not impact the topology creation. In order to keep this tutorial simple we will just extend our Tomcat from the tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer node type. Properties The first property we want to define is the version of tomcat that this tomcat definition supports. Indeed all the tomcat versions doesn’t have the same capabilities, for example tomcat 7.x supports web-sockets while this is not supported in tomcat 5.x for example. Version property as stated earlier is already defined in SoftwareComponent, it is possible however to override it to add an additional constraint. In this example we want to describe a tomcat node for all versions 7 so we will redefine the version property (with the same version type) and add constraints . Second property that we want to add in this tutorial is the java options to use to startup the Tomcat server. This will allow users to specify the java memory requirements and garbage collection settings. Name Type Required Default Constraints version version true 7 Between 7 (inclusive) and 8 exclusive java_ops string false None None fastconnect.nodes.Tomcat : abstract : true derived_from : tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer documentation : Tomcat application server is an application server that supports deployment of java web applications (war). properties : version : type : version constraints : - greater_or_equal : 7 - less_than : 8 java_ops : type : string Tomcat node with the version between [7 and 8) Of course we could add more properties to the tomcat node in order to allow configuration of other server related properties. In this tutorial we will just use the properties mentioned above. Note that as ALIEN supports the versioning of the archives it is easy to add properties later in a next version of the component. Requirements Next important section to describe on the Tomcat type is the list of requirements. As Tomcat inherit from SoftwareComponent it has an inherited requirement over a Compute node (this requirement can be fulfilled in a topology by using an hosted_on relationship). The other requirement for a Tomcat node is to have a java installed. We will model this by adding a java requirement to the tomcat node. A requirements can express constraints on some of the target capability or node, properties. Here we reference a requirement on a Java Node and specify a constraint on the version of the java node. Name Type Lower bound Upper bound Constraints Notes host tosca.nodes.Compute 1 (default) 1 (default)   Inherited from tosca.nodes.SoftwareComponent java fastconnect.nodes.Java 1 (default) 1 (default) Greater or equal than 7   fastconnect.nodes.Tomcat : abstract : true derived_from : tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer documentation : Tomcat application server is an application server that supports deployment of java web applications (war). properties : version : type : version constraints : - greater_or_equal : 7 - less_than : 8 java_ops : type : string requirements : java : type : fastconnect.nodes.Java constraints : version : { greater_or_equal : 1.7 } Tomcat node inherit from the requirement on a hosting compute node that is defined by the SoftwareComponent TOSCA normative node. Here we define an abstract Tomcat node that doesn’t have any specific requirement for the compute node (os type etc.) so we don’t have to override the parent requirement. Of course it is possible to override a parent requirement to specify more advanced constraints. Capabilities Tomcat has multiple capabilities and the two main capabilities that we want to define in this tutorial are the ability to hort some War node(s) on top of Tomcat as well as it’s http endpoint. Name Type Lower bound Upper bound http tosca.capabilities.Endpoint 0 (default) unbounded (default) war_host fastconnect.nodes.War 0 (default) unbounded (default) In case of the http capability we want to define the port of the tosca.capabilties.Endpoint to be actually the one define in the fastconnect.nodes.Tomcat : abstract : true derived_from : tosca.nodes.ApplicationServer documentation : Tomcat application server is an application server that supports deployment of java web applications (war). properties : version : type : version constraints : - greater_or_equal : 7 - less_than : 8 java_ops : type : string requirements : java : type : fastconnect.nodes.Java constraints : version : { greater_or_equal : 1.7 } capabilties : http : type : tosca.capabilities.Endpoint properties : port : 8080 war_host : type : fastconnect.capabilities.War Conclusion Following the tutorial you should be able to define your own types to be added in ALIEN repository. TOSCA’s requirement and capabilties mechanisms as well as constraint validations allows users to leverage your types so they can easily build topologies and minimize errors in configurations. The next step is to actually implement the type in order to have a type that can indeed be instantiated in a topology.

"},{"title":"New in 1.1.0","baseurl":"","url":"/documentation/1.1.0/whatsnew.html","date":null,"categories":[],"body":" Orchestrator and Locations “Cloud” concept as it existed in 1.0.0 has been replaced by Orchestrator and Location concepts that reflects in a better way our actual supports. “Cloud” name was also not a great choice as it could refer to a “cloud” but also to some existing hosts pools, for example that people doesn’t really consider as clouds. Anyway “location” sounds much better and can be easily understood. The refactoring also allows to give a much nicer support for orchestrators that can deploy to multiple locations from a single manager (like Apache Brooklyn) and bring great features and openings like the Location Matching. It was also a mandatory step to open us to multi-location deployments and other very cool features that we want to support in future releases. More details on Orchestrators and Locations are provided in the Concept section. Location matching Location matching allows to match a topology against locations and provide choices of the best locations for the topology. Default implementation is simple and just provides all locations on which the current user has the deployer role. Plugin system allows to create advanced location matching, overriding the location matching logic and event the choice selection ui. Node matching Node matching is an existing feature of Alien 4 Cloud but 1.1.0 introduce more possibilities thanks to the location refactoring and related custom types. It is now possible to benefits from the most specific configuration options of a IaaS without loosing the ability to design portable topologies. Moreover node matching is now pluggable so you can override our logic with more advanced or custom logic. Custom Workflows 1.1.0 version keeps the simplicity of TOSCA declarative modeling of topologies and automatic workflow generation but introduce in addition a support for imperative workflows. Imperative workflow is something we are pushing into TOSCA TC and is planned to be part of TOSCA 1.1 specification. Indeed if declarative support is the preferred way to address workflows and topologies some specific scenarios may require more complex workflows that cannot yet be addressed through declarative modeling. BlockStorage support Block storage support has changed in 1.1.0. In 1.0.0 when a block storage was defined and attached to a Compute node in a topology, the storage was automatically attached, partitioned, formatted and mounted. This behavior has changed and the Block Storage is now attached but neither partitioned, formatted and mounted. In order to do so we created a separate TOSCA node LinuxFileSystem (right now available for linux only). TOSCA support improvements We have upgraded our normative types support to be closer to TOSCA. In 1.1.0 we recommend people to use the following version of the normative types: “1.0.0-ALIEN11”. It basically is a version derived from the TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML 1.0.0 preview in order to match our Alien TOSCA like DSL (there is still some effort planned for 1.2.0 to increase TOSCA support). Orchestrators support Cloudify 3 support Alien 4 cloud 1.1.0 brings support for cloudify 3.3.x orchestrator. Thanks to alien 4 cloud the TOSCA support of cloudify 3 is improved. In addition we added some workarounds to bring to cloudify 3 support for scalability on OpenStack for bigdata scenarios we had to handle (scaling of a combined group of nodes, such as Compute and BlockStorage) and some very basic self-healing support (More info here ). Cloudify 2 End Of Life GigaSpaces doesn’t support cloudify 2 anymore, as a consequence we stopped investing efforts on our cloudify 2 provider and it won’t work with alien 1.1.0. Hopefully if all your artifacts uses only portable scripts and no orchestrator specific logic migration to cloudify 3 you won’t have migration effort! Apache Brooklyn integration We’re very happy that our friends from Apache Brooklyn invested in the integration of Brooklyn orchestrator to Alien4Cloud in order to bring Apache Brooklyn into the TOSCA interoperable world.
